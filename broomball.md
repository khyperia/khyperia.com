pagetitle: Broomball
---
Michigan Tech (my university) has a huge tradition of playing the sport Broomball. This page is a primer/reference to my hallmates who are first-years on my team.

Broomball: whack the ball with the stick into the box, hopefully without falling on your face in the process.

Poke me with any questions you have!

Games are two 15 minute halves. Games are scheduled every 45 minutes, and there's usually a 5ish minute warmup (the rest of time is halftime, getting off/on the ice, getting helmets, etc.). The schedule is almost always running late by 10-15 minutes (but we should still show up on time, in case they're not).

Rules that affect the game most often:

* Half ice: when the goalie makes a save and throws the ball back onto the ice, a player must touch it before it crosses mid-court. Penalty: other team gets the ball at mid-court.
* Kick pass: The ball may not touch a player's body (foot) and then another player on the same team (intentionally) - i.e., no kicking the ball. If the player who (accidentally) kicked it cannot reach the ball (hey, it's ice, slippery stuff), let the other team touch it first - and if you notice a team member kicked it (or bounced off them), yell at your team going for the ball to let the other team touch it first ("Don't touch it!"). Penalty: other team gets the ball at that location.
* High stick: Don't raise your stick above your waist. Just don't. (Even for backswing/follow-through)
* "Goalie, clear the yard!": I have no idea what this is called, but refs yell this phrase when goalie is holding the ball (e.g. after a save). This is an indicator that players should back up (clear the yard) and give the goalie space (instead of trying to repeatedly whack the ball in), and get ready for the goalie to toss the ball out. They have a set amount of time to do so, and the ref starts counting down from 5 if they take too long.

**Do not take your helmet off on the ice!** - this is a $20 fine if you do! Even after the game is over and everyone's celebrating, *wait until you are off the ice!*

No spikes/etc on shoes. At the start of the game, the ref calls over everyone to check the stiffness of your broom, as well as see the bottom of your shoes to check this (try not to fall over when standing on one foot).

Strategy, the "ish, idk" style:

Teams consist of six people, usually split up into: goalie, two defense, three offense.

Goalie does the obvious job. (Side note, if anyone wants to be goalie, let me know!)

Defense is oriented around "clearing" the ball - get it to the other side, where an offensive player is hopefully waiting. This position involves using your body as a human meatshield to stop the ball wherever it's going, and then whacking the ball really hard at an angle that makes it through the tangled mess of falling-over players to hopefully half-court (ricocheting off the walls is helpful!) - in the past, I have been a defensive player (I guess I'm good at the "human meatshield" and "blindly whack it" bits).

Offense is oriented around control/passing/scoring. This needs a lot more accuracy when handling and passing the ball - you're passing to a teammate or shooting at the (rather small) goal. Doing the defense-style "blindly whack it really hard" doesn't work too hot.

There are two types of offense (generally - offensive strategy varies wildly between teams/games): the two side players are mirrored. They drive the ball up the side to the opponent's corner, then center the ball in front of the goal. The player opposite the side the ball is on is usually around the middle of the court, near the opponent's goal (far up) - ready to take the centering pass into the goal.

The middle player is sort of a midfielder in soccer - all around superman, helping defense clear the ball (usually more aggressive than defense, because if they slip by them, it's fine), and being just behind the other two offense when driving it up, in case they lose control. They help score when centering too (whenever the ball is centered, the game becomes a heaping pile of chaos). In my past two years of playing, my RA always had this role, and he was *extremely good* - carried the whole team at times. I may fall into this role, as I have the most broomball experience? (of course, people can play whatever they want to, and rotate)

In general, offensive strategy revolves pushing up the sides, then centering to score.

At the start of the game and after scoring, the ball is dropped mid-court and the center offense faces off. Goalie is also involved - ref calls "Goalie, are you ready?" and goalie does whatever to indicate yes (please answer for the whole team, though, not just yourself - if someone isn't ready, don't say yes), and then the same for the other team, before dropping the ball.

The most important strategy, though, is to have fun! In the end it doesn't really matter anyway, and it can be fun to just run around on the ice. The roles I just said are more guidelines.

Random notes:

Knee pads (rollerskating knee pads, etc.) are very, VERY good - you will be dropping to your knees (or falling) frequently, and even though you're probably wearing snowpants or similar, ice is hard! I also use elbow pads, as falling backwards onto your elbows is not pleasant, as well as wrist guards, because I'd rather not break my wrists.

Do not forget your ID! You cannot play if you forget your ID, and sprinting back to your dorm room is not fun! As we're getting ready to leave, make sure everyone has their ID. Your room keys are also probably good to bring :)

Helmets are provided. Brooms and knee pads are not. Jerseys are provided when teams aren't obviously clear (e.g. one team has their own jerseys for everyone)

We will have broom-making activities at some point. Broom regulations are kind of strict (see the broomball website's guides), but basically consist of a wooden straw broom with metal bits removed and an extremely large amount of duct tape applied. Get fancy with your duct tape designs!

There's a thing called a "[n] step check", where n is 0-2 - for example, "1 step check". This is announced to captains before every game, and is the number of steps one may take when checking someone (although I've honestly never seen an intentional check, so don't worry). The step amount is related to the slipperyness of the ice - 2 steps means it's extremely slippery (and hard to gain speed, hence the high step count), 0 step means you can just sort of bump someone (since it's probably blizzarding out these days and the rinks are full of snow, not ice, so it's more like floor hockey than broomball). As such, it's usually how we communicate slipperyness when we're getting ready - if someone says they heard it's 0 step check, people might dress lighter since there's a lot of running around rather than awkwardly shuffling.

The walls of the rink are usually more snowy and have more traction, plus you can hold on to the walls and push off for quick velocity changes. This is important when you're offense and driving up the sides.

I hate (with a *passion*) conditions that have the court be spotted with packed, hard, concrete-like snow, with random blobs of extremely slippery ice. Literally the worst :(
