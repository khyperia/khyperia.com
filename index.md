Hi, you've reached \[ khyperia.com | acefrom.space \], please leave a message after the tone.

I don't enjoy working with web things, so this is just plain markdown converted to html with pandoc and [css inspired from this](https://gist.github.com/killercup/5917178). (Hey, it loads insanely fast, though!)

* [My about page](about.html), which contains words about me (and links to other sites).
* [Astrophotography archive](space/) of photos I've taken with my telescopes.
* [Raytraced fractals](https://imgur.com/a/rmM4v) I made with my program.
* [My coding blog](https://khyperia.github.io/)
* [Various files](f/) hosted here. (e.g. binary builds of my projects)
* [Tutorials](tutorials/) I've made, for when I've re-explained something to friends way too often for my sanity.
* [The source](https://github.com/khyperia/khyperia.com) to this website.
