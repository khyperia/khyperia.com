Hi, you've reached \[ [khyperia.com](https://khyperia.com) | [acefrom.space](https://acefrom.space) \], please leave a message after the tone.

I don't enjoy working with web things, so this is just plain markdown converted to html with [markdown.pl](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [css inspired from this](https://gist.github.com/killercup/5917178). (Hey, it loads insanely fast, though!)

* [My about page](about.html), which contains words about me (and links to other sites).
* [Astrophotography archive](space/) of photos I've taken with my telescopes.
* [Raytraced fractals](fractals.html) I made with my program. [Some more are here](https://imgur.com/a/rmM4v).
* [My coding blog](https://khyperia.github.io/)
* [Tutorials](tutorials/) I've made, for when I've re-explained something to friends way too often for my sanity.
