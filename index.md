Hi, you've reached khyperia.com, please leave a message after the tone.

* [Tutorials](tutorials/) I've made, for when I've re-explained something to friends way too often for my sanity.
* [Various files](f/) hosted here. (e.g. binary builds of my projects)
* [Astrophotography archive](space/) of photos I've taken with my telescopes.
* [My coding blog](https://khyperia.github.io/)
* [My about page](about.html), which contains words about me (and links to other sites).
