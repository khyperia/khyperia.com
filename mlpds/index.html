        <h3>Etiquette for the MLP Drawing School Discord</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Don&#39;t be a butt! [](/dontbeabutt-in "This is the greatest commandment")</li>
            <li>When art is posted, donâ€™t critique unless the artist asks for crit.</li>
            <li>Explicit and suggestive content is allowed, but we would like to keep the general chats welcoming to all. Always tag suggesting content (eg. by adding &quot;[suggestive]&quot; in the line) and prevent link previews by breaking suggestive links. Break links by surrounding the link in angle brackets like so: <span class="code">&lt;http://example.com/image.png&gt;</span>. Post explicit links to the adult channels.</li>
            <li>Nothing illegal or borderline illegal. This includes torrents to cracked software, dumps of paid art packs, foalcon, etc. Pony episode links are okay. If you&#39;re not sure, just ask.</li>
            <li>Offtopic discussions are encouraged, but don't clutter the general chats if there is a room better suited to the topic. The main exception to this is art. Art belongs everywhere. ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>We like to prevent people from being spoiled for a reasonable amount of time. For 48 hours after the airing of an episode, spoiler talk about that episode goes in <span class="channel">#episode-spoilers</span>. All other spoiler / future episode talk goes in <span class="channel">#spoilerific</span>. Spoilers include but are not limited to episode titles, descriptions, and screenshots.</li>
            <li>Light RP is allowed but be awesome if someone asks you to tone it down. Feel free to go hog wild in the rp chats linked in <span class="channel">#announcements</span>!</li>
            <li>Drama llamas will be hunted with prejudice.</li>
            <li>No spamming! Spamming includes: many one word messages in a row, posting very large blocks of text, gratuitous caps lock, and copious use of the bots outside of the <span class="channel">#bots</span> channel.</li>
            <li>We are not a support group. You should not dwell on life crisis issues on this server. If you need help, please visit the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlesupportgroup">My Little Support Group subreddit</a>, the <a href="https://discord.gg/0i3tTVbTo6cyvyPe">My Little Support Group Discord server</a>, the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/0X1B9skZ7gXvglgV/">Patch Gaming discord</a> (non-pony),or contact a local professional in your area. Here's a handy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines">International List of Crisis Hotlines</a>.</li>
            <li>No mules, no exceptions, no refunds.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Rule breaking will typically be handled first with a warning, then a kick, temp ban, and finally a permanent ban. Every situation is unique, though, so mods may modify this as needed on a case by case basis.</p>

        <h3>FAQ and Info</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Why do I get an error when posting links, images, or want I try to use voice activity in chat?</b> &mdash; A mod will have to give you the voice role. Ping <span class="code">@mod</span> to request the role.</li>
            <li><b>Why do we have two general chats and what's the difference?</b> &mdash; There's no difference except for the names. Two general chats allows for multiple conversations when the server gets busy.</li>
            <li><b>What is considered safe, suggestive or explicit?</b> &mdash; Here are our current guidelines:
                <ul>
                    <li>Explicit material typically includes gore, genitals, or other &quot;extreme&quot; material. Keep this to the adult channels.</li>
                    <li>Suggestive material can include art with emphasis on genital areas, suggestive situations, or other borderline material. It&#39;s a fuzzy definition, so tag and break links if you aren&#39;t sure or ask a mod.</li>
                    <li>Safe material is generally whatever isn&#39;t included in the previous two categories.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>How do I get access to the adult channels?</b> &mdash; If you're over 18, use <span class="code">!roles nsfw on</span> to opt-in or <span class="code">!roles nsfw off</span> to opt-out.</li>
            <li><b>How can I link something suggestive without having discord show a preview image?</b> &mdash; To break suggestive links so they&#39;re not automatically previewed in others&#39; clients, surround the link with angle brackets like so: <span class="code">&lt;http://example.com/image.png&gt;</span>.</li>
            <li><b>What's a "drawalong"?</b> &mdash; Drawalongs are a group drawing exercise where a small group of artists will all draw from the same prompt for 30 minutes. The point of the time limit is to try to get as much done on the piece as possible in a short amount of time. After the first 30 minutes, there's a short break for critique among the participants (don't forget rule #2!). Finally there is 30 more minutes for everyone to finish their pieces using the critiques.</li>
            <li><b>OMG stop with the rules and FAQ and blah blah blah already, how do I get in so I can talk and see the channels?!</b> &mdash; Well if you've made it this far, you're ready to know how to get started. Send a private message to <span class="code">@princess luna</span> with the command <span class="code">!warden access mlpds</span> and you'll get access to the rest of the rooms and the ability to send messages.</li>
            <li><b>Pegesi? Earth ponies? What are you, some sort of small, colorful horses?</b> &mdash; Silly group names are silly! If you want to join one of the pony groups, you can manage your group affiliation by using the <span class="code">!roles pony clear/earth/pegasus/unicorn/equestrian</span> command.</li>
            <li><b>I've got a different question. Who can I ask?</b> &mdash; Feel free to ping a moderator by using <span class="code">@mod</span> in your message.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Discord Extras</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The web client works, but there are advantages to using the native discord app for your OS (except linux ðŸ˜¡). <a href="https://discordapp.com/apps">Download the client here.</a></li>
            <li>Want ponymotes (aka reddit emotes) in your client? Check out the ponymotes plugins for your client:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/ByzantineFailure/BPM-for-Discord/releases">Desktop Client</a> - Ask in <span class="channel">#tech</span> if you have issues with installation.</li>
                <li><a href="https://ponymotes.net/bpm/">Web Client</a></li>
            </ul>

            <li>Don't like discord's interface or clients? Want more of that juicy 1980's IRC goodness in your life? Check out bitlbee and the corresponding discord plugin, or the weechat plugin.</li>
            <ul>
