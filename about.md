Hi, I'm khy, she/her/hers.

I currently exist as a student at Michigan Tech studying computer science, and starting this summer (2017) I will be working on the C#/VB compiler team at Microsoft.

You can find me lots of places. Chances are, if you find a wild khyperia somewhere, it's me. Some sites I check daily are:

* Twitter: [\@khyperia](https://twitter.com/khyperia)
* Github: [khyperia](https://github.com/khyperia)
* Coding blog: [On github pages](https://khyperia.github.io/)
* Tumblr: [khyperia](https://khyperia.tumblr.com/) (for friends and random stuff)
* IRC: I hop around various networks as months go on, but I'll be khyperia wherever I am.
* Email: khyperia (that one symbol, y'know) live.com

I love talking! Feel free to message me on any of the above mentioned mediums, using whatever you feel is appropriate for the topic. If I don't respond within a reasonable time, email is usually the quickest and most reliable.

Some things about myself:

* Compilers. Raytracers. Programming! I love computers.
* LGBT! I'm a bit of an alphabet soup (labels are hard, but useful!)
* I love pretty much anything space-related, and used to do astrophotography! (Haven't had access to my telescopes for a while)
* I made a mod for Kerbal Space Program called HyperEdit. (I have handed it off after many years of development)
* Fractals are cool. Raytracers are cool. [Here are some raytraced fractals](https://imgur.com/a/rmM4v) I made with the program I wrote from scratch.
* I try to live by "treat others the way they want to be treated", and am happy when people point out if and when I forget that. Unless you're an asshole. Then you have no right to call me an asshole. Respect me and I'll respect you in return &#10084;

Have a beautiful day!
