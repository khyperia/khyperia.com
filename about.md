Hi, I'm khy, she/her/hers.

I work at Resolution in Stockholm on VR games! I have some compiler experience in the past: I've worked at Microsoft on the C# compiler, Mozilla on their JS engine, and Embark on rust-gpu. I graduated from Michigan Tech studying computer science.

You can find me lots of places. Chances are, if you find a wild khyperia somewhere, it's me. Here are some common ones:

* Twitter: [@khyperia](https://twitter.com/khyperia)
* Github: [khyperia](https://github.com/khyperia)
* Email: web&#128293;khyperia.com

Some things about myself:

* Fractals are cool. Raytracers are cool. Put them together and you have a project I've been working on since 2011!
* Extremely gay &#127752;
* I love pretty much anything space-related, and do astrophotography!
* I try to live by "treat others the way they want to be treated", and am happy when people point out if and when I forget that. Unless you're a jerk. Then you have no right to call me a jerk. Respect me and I'll respect you in return &#10084;

Have a beautiful day!
