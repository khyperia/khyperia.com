Hi, I'm khy, she/her/hers.

I work at Resolution in Stockholm on VR games! I have some compiler experience in the past: I've worked at Microsoft on the C# compiler, Mozilla on their JS engine, and Embark on rust-gpu. I graduated from Michigan Tech studying computer science.

You can find me lots of places. Chances are, if you find a wild khyperia somewhere, it's me. Here are some common ones:

* Twitter: [@khyperia](https://twitter.com/khyperia)
* Mastodon: [@khyperia@mas.to](https://mas.to/@khyperia)
* Cohost: [khyperia](https://cohost.org/khyperia)
* Github: [khyperia](https://github.com/khyperia)
* Email: web&#128293;khyperia.com

Some things about myself:

* Fractals are cool. Raytracers are cool. Put them together and you have a project I've been working on since 2011!
* I love pretty much anything space-related, and do astrophotography!
* Extremely gay &#127752;, ace, and anxious

Have a beautiful day!
