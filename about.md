Hi, I'm khy, she/her/hers.

I work at Mozilla on Firefox's javascript engine (spidermonkey). I graduated-ish from Michigan Tech studying computer science.

You can find me lots of places. Chances are, if you find a wild khyperia somewhere, it's me. Here are some common ones:

* Twitter: [@khyperia](https://twitter.com/khyperia)
* Github: [khyperia](https://github.com/khyperia)
* IRC: I hop around, but I'm khyperia everywhere.
* Email: khyperia&#128293;live.com

Some things about myself:

* Compilers. Raytracers. Programming!
* Polyam and extremely gay &#127752;
* Fractals are cool. Raytracers are cool. Put them together and you have a project I've been working on since 2011!
* I love pretty much anything space-related, and do astrophotography!
* I try to live by "treat others the way they want to be treated", and am happy when people point out if and when I forget that. Unless you're a jerk. Then you have no right to call me a jerk. Respect me and I'll respect you in return &#10084;

Have a beautiful day!
