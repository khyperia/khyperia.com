Hi, I'm khy, she/her/hers.

I work on the C#/VB compiler team at Microsoft, and graduated from Michigan Tech studying computer science.

You can find me lots of places. Chances are, if you find a wild khyperia somewhere, it's me. Here are some common ones:

* Twitter: [\@khyperia](https://twitter.com/khyperia)
* Github: [khyperia](https://github.com/khyperia)
* Coding blog: [On github pages](https://khyperia.github.io/)
* Tumblr: [khyperia](https://khyperia.tumblr.com/) (for friends and random stuff)
* IRC: I hop around, but I'm khyperia everywhere.
* Email: khyperia (that one symbol, y'know) live.com

Some things about myself:

* Compilers. Raytracers. Programming!
* Panro and ace!
* Fractals are cool. Raytracers are cool. [Here are some raytraced fractals](https://imgur.com/a/rmM4v) made with my program.
* I love pretty much anything space-related, and used to do astrophotography! (Haven't had access to my telescopes for a while)
* I try to live by "treat others the way they want to be treated", and am happy when people point out if and when I forget that. Unless you're a jerk. Then you have no right to call me a jerk. Respect me and I'll respect you in return &#10084;

Have a beautiful day!
