Hi, I'm khy, she/her/hers.

I currently exist as a student at Michigan Tech studying computer science, and starting this summer (2017) I will be working on the C#/VB compiler team at Microsoft.

You can find me lots of places. Chances are, if you find a wild khyperia somewhere, it's me. Some sites I check daily are:

* Twitter: [\@khyperia](https://twitter.com/khyperia), mostly code-related.
* Github: [khyperia](https://github.com/khyperia).
* Coding blog: [On github pages](https://khyperia.github.io/), long rants on code.
* Tumblr: [khyperia](https://khyperia.tumblr.com/), for friends and other random stuff.
* IRC: I hop around various networks as months go on, but I'll be khyperia wherever I am.
* Email: khyperia (that one symbol, y'know) live.com - I don't need more spam from web crawlers finding my address :)

I love talking, feel free to message me on any of the above mentioned mediums, with whatever site you feel is appropriate for the topic. If I don't respond within a reasonable time, email is usually the quickest and most reliable.

Some things about myself:

* Compilers. Raytracers. Programming! I love computers.
* LGBT! I'm a bit of an alphabet soup (labels are hard!)
* I love pretty much anything space-related, and used to do astrophotography! (Haven't had access to my telescopes for a while)
* I made a mod for Kerbal Space Program called HyperEdit. (I have handed it off after many years of development)
* Fractals are cool. Raytracers are cool. [Here are some raytraced fractals](https://imgur.com/a/rmM4v) I made with the program I wrote from scratch.
* I use Arch Linux, but believe that you should use whatever OS is best for you.
* I try to live by "treat others the way they want to be treated", and am happy when people point out if and when I forget that.

Have a beautiful day!
